# Kernelized-Perceptron
Implementation of Perceptron Algorithm using String Kernel in Python3

Kernel.py
The string kernel Kp(s, t) is the number of substrings of length p that are common to both s and
t, where a string that occurs a times in s and b times in t is counted ab times.

Kernel_q2.py
The modified string kernel Mp(s, t) is the number of substrings of length p that are common to both
s and t, where a string that occurs a times in s and b times in t is counted only once.

Kernel_q3.py
This program returns the substrings(length=5) corresponding to the coordinates in w with the highest positive values.
